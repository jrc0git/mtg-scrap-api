# MTG scrap api
The idea behind this tiny project is to provide endpoints to retrieve data from different pages related to Magic the Gathering. Many of these sites don't have an api for public use, hence I decided to scrap the data I needed for my personal projects using python's library BeautifulSoup.

I used flask and flask-restful.
